# buffer_autohide-rs

A rust rewrite of the Weechat [buffer_autohide.py](https://github.com/notmatti/buffer_autohide) script.

## Why?

The [buffer_autohide.py](https://github.com/notmatti/buffer_autohide) script is perfectly fine.
I am just eager to learn a bit of Rust.

This work is a WIP and is not intended to be used for now.
